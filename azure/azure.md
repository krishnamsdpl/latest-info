Azure Storage Service:
 Azure Blob:
 Azure Blob: We can have Azure Blob storage within the storage account, which is used to store the unstructured data such as media files, documents, etc.

Azure Storage Account
An Azure Storage Account is a secure account, which provides you access to services in Azure Storage. 
The storage account is like an administrative container, and within that, 
we can have several services like blobs, files, queues, tables, disks, etc. And when we create a storage account in Azure, we will get the unique namespace for our storage resources. That unique namespace forms the part of the URL. The storage account name should be unique across all existing storage account name in Azure.


Access Tiers
There are four types of access tiers available:
Premium Storage (preview): 
It provides high-performance hardware for data that is accessed frequently.
Hot storage: It is optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.
Cool Storage: It is optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days.
Archive Storage: It is optimized for storing files that are rarely accessed and stored for a minimum of 180 days with flexible latency needs (on the order of hours). 

Storage account endpoints
Whenever we create a storage account, we will get an endpoint to access the data within the storage account. So each object that we stored in Azurestorage has an address, which includes your unique account name and the combination of an account name, and service endpoint, which forms the endpoint for your storage account.
For example, if your general-purpose account name is mystorageaccount then generally the default endpoints for different services looks like:

Azure Blob storage: http://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net.

Azure Table storage: http://mystorageaccount.table.core.windows.net

Azure Queues storage: http://mystorageaccount.queue.core.windows.net

Azure files: http://mystorageaccount.file.core.windows.net


29-05-2023:

The most fundamental building block of Azure network services is the virtual network. Using a virtual network, we can deploy our isolated network on Azure. And we can divide the virtual network into multiple parts using subnets. 
For example â€“
Webserver subnet, 
App servers1 subnet, 
App servers2 subnet, 
Database subnet, 
Gateway subnet, 
Virtual Appliance subnet, etc.

Service Protection: After the deployment of all these services, we need to protect these services. Azure provides several protection strategies.

DDoS Protection: The DDoS protection will protect our workload in the virtual network from DDoS attacks. There is a two-tier available in DDoS protection. One is the basic, which is free and enabled automatically. If we need the advance capability, then we can go for the DDoS standard tier.

Firewall: When we need network security, we use a firewall. Azure provides a firewall service which you can centrally manage inbound and outbound firewall rules. 
We can able to create network firewall rules, application firewall rules, inbound SNAT rules, outbound DNAT rules, etc.

Network Security Groups: If you think the firewall is too costly for you, then we can use Network security groups. We can filer the inbound and outbound traffic using network security groups. We can attach the network security group at two levels, one at the subnet level and other we can attach to a virtual machine.

Application Security Groups: Microsoft introduces the application security group to put all the server related to one application in one application security group and use that application security group in network security group inbound and outbound rules. The primary purpose of the Application Security Group is to simplify the rule creation in NSG's.
Service Availability We must make sure that our application is highly available and resilient to regional failures, data center failure, and rack failures. Azure provides some services to make our application highly available; these are:

Traffic Manager: Microsoft Azure traffic manager controls the distribution of user traffic for service endpoints in different regions. 
Service endpoints supported by Traffic Manager include Azure VMs, Web Apps, Cloud services, etc.
It uses DNS to direct the client request to the right endpoint based on a traffic-routing method and the health of endpoints.

Load Balancer: Load balancer is used to distribute the traffic evenly between a pool of web servers or application servers. 
There are two types of the load balancer, one is external load balancer which sits outside the virtual network and the second one is an internal load balancer that sits inside the virtual network.

Application Gateway: Using the application gateway, we can achieve URL path-based routing, Multi-site hosting, etc.

Availability Zones: By deploying our virtual machines into different availability zones, 
we can route our application traffic to virtual machines that are located in different availability zone in case of failure of datacenter within any region.

Peering: 

To enable communication between two virtual networks, we can establish peering. 
We can do this peering with virtual networks within the same region. If we have an Azure virtual network in another region,
then we can use global peering. And for the on-premises data center, we have two options, and one is the site to site VPN, 
which will get established over the Internet. But for private connectivity, we have to use the express route.

Virtual Network:

The Azure Virtual Network is a logical representation of the network in the cloud. So, by creating an Azure Virtual Network, we can define our private IP address range on Azure and deploy different kinds of Azure resources. For Example - Azure virtual machine, App service environment, Integration service environment, etc.

Subnet

Subnet plays a vital role because many configurations will be done at a subnet level. It is a range of IP addresses in the VNet. 
Vnet can be divided into multiple subnets based on different design considerations, 
for example - we can deploy a virtual machine, App services environment, integration service environment, etc. 
VMs & PaaS services deployed to subnets n the same VNet and can communicate with each other without any extra configuration.
Route tables, NSG, Service endpoints, and policies are configured to the subnets.

What is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)

Role definition
A role definition is a collection of permissions. It's typically just called a role. A role definition lists the actions that can be performed, such as read, write, and delete. Roles can be high-level, like owner, or specific, like virtual machine reader.

Security principal
A security principal is an object that represents a user, group, service principal, or managed identity that is requesting access to Azure resources. You can assign a role to any of these security principals.

Role assignments
A role assignment is the process of attaching a role definition to a user, group, service principal, or managed identity at a particular scope for the purpose of granting access. Access is granted by creating a role assignment, and access is revoked by removing a role assignment.

The following diagram shows an example of a role assignment. In this example, the Marketing group has been assigned the Contributor role for the pharma-sales resource group. This means that users in the Marketing group can create or manage any Azure resource in the pharma-sales resource group. Marketing users do not have access to resources outside the pharma-sales resource group, unless they are part of another role assignment.
